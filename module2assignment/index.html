<h1>The Quitter - By Robert Service</h1>


<p id="section1"> <span id="versetitle"> VERSE 1 </span><br><br>
When you're lost in the Wild, and you're scared as a child, 
And Death looks you bang in the eye,
And you're sore as a boil, it's according to Hoyle
	To cock your revolver and . . . die.
But the Code of a Man says: "Fight all you can,"
	And self-dissolution is barred.
In hunger and woe, oh, it's easy to blow . . .
	It's the hell-served-for-breakfast that's hard.</p>

"You're sick of the game!" Well, now, that's a shame.
	You're young and you're brave and you're bright.
"You've had a raw deal!" I know -- but don't squeal,
	Buck up, do your damnedest, and fight.
It's the plugging away that will win you the day,
	So don't be a piker, old pard!
Just draw on your grit; it's so easy to quit:
	It's the keeping-your-chin-up that's hard.</p>
<p id="section3"> <span id="versetitle"> VERSE 3 </span><br><br>
It's easy to cry that you're beaten -- and die;
	It's easy to crawfish and crawl;
But to fight and to fight when hope's out of sight --
	Why, that's the best game of them all!
And though you come out of each gruelling bout,
	All broken and beaten and scarred,
Just have one more try -- it's dead easy to die,
	It's the keeping-on-living that's hard.</p>
